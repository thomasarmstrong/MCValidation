% This file is meant to set or indicate useful default values for all
% cameras with SiPM type photosensors - with actual values for the
% specific cameras overriding the values from this file.

% Although not every absorbed photon will result in an avalanche in
% the silicon, this loss is part of the photon detection efficiency.
pm_collection_efficiency = 1.0

pm_transit_time = 1.0      % Just a guess
transit_time_jitter  = 0.1 % Just a guess
pm_voltage_variation = 0.0 % Not a useful concept with SiPM
pm_gain_index = 0.0        % Irrelevant with zero voltage variation (gain as function of PMT high-voltage)
qe_variation = 0.02        % Random QE variation
gain_variation = 0.02      % Random gain variation

% quantum_efficiency = ... % Photon detection efficiency (PDE) for SiPM-type sensors
% pm_photoelectron_spectrum = ... % Useful default single-p.e. response with optical cross-talk

% The 'pm_average_gain has no direct implications on the analog (discriminator) 
% and digitized (FADC) amplitudes (which may involve pre-amplifiers) but on the
% effect of TRIGGER_CURRENT_LIMIT together with NIGHTSKY_BACKGROUND.
pm_average_gain = 4e4
% trigger_current_limit = 20.0 % [microAmps] 

nightsky_background = all:0.040 % That would be 40 MHz NSB + dark rate in every pixel

% discriminator_pulse_shape= ...
% fadc_pulse_shape = ...

% For SiPM pixel saturation by cells discharged by other photo-electrons:
pixel_cells = 14400 % That is 6 mm pixels with 50 micrometer cells (120x120).
